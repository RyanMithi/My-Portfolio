	<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

	<p>I was born in a small city of Mzuzu which is in the Northern part of Malawi, at St Johns Hospital on the 1st of July 1900. I am the first of the a family of four chidlren, 3 boys and 1 girl. I was born from a christian family and was raised as christian.</p>

	<p>I have grown up in the ghetto area of Zolozolo where substance abuse and living close to crime is always an issue especially to youth. My parents were very strict when it came to association with our surrounding to keep us safe from ill behaviour. Basically we would play indoors and most just within the house circles within ourselves as family.</p>
